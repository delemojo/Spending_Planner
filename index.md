Easy and simple, every important expense at a glance to better keep track of your money and save up easier.

How it works:
- Set a monthly spending limit.
- Save reoccurring Payments, wether they are monthly, weekly, quarterly, half-yearly or even yearly.
- Add spontaneous expenses or earnings and save them to a category
- On the Dashboard you have everything at a glance and per tap on the tiles you can get a deeper inside on every single aspect. *
